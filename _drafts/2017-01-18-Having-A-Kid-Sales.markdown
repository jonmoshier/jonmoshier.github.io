what having a kid has taught me about sales

----

You don't sell the steak, you sell the adventure.

Bath time is miserable, I mean, who wants to take a bath? But bathtime doesn't have to be about getting clean, it can be about rescuing a duck or being a pirate.

That's good magic. Sell the sizzle. Get excited.

Get consent! Get buy in! It's not my idea, it's our idea.

Build the team. Build the shared (joined, co-owned, team, co-opted, other words) vision!

Get excited, get excited, get excited, WAIT!!!! Pump the breaks! What if we do... THIS! <- Follow the trend, ride the trend, ride the wave of enthusiasm.

Steer toward a goal but allow those unplanned moments, that serendipity.
