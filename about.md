Hey! I'm Jon. I live in Denver, CO and I'm a software engineer.

After getting my degree in Economics from the University of Colorado, I spent some time working as a professional chef. After a few years of that, I decided to pursue something else and became a Software Engineer!

I currently work at <xbtransmed.com> building tools to help oncologists make better use of patient data.
